Yelp Data Analysis

This is a UW-Madison - Sp18 - Stat 628- Module 2 project. In this project, we aim at predicting Yelp star rates based on review text with common machine learning models.

We select word features that have large frequency and significant variation among different stars, then come up with models based on linear support vector machine, long-short term memory network and other methods.

Data：This folder contains data generated in this project. Traindata and testdata are reformatted traning and test dataset. Others are all splitted ones. 

RCode：This folder contains code used in this project. The code with name "reformat" is for negation word transformation; the code with name "Matrix" are for sparse matrix and those with "model" are all for model construction.

PythonCode:This folder is for python code of sparse matrix and model construction.

Matrix: The X_freq is for matrix of frequency and X_occur is for occurrence. The sparse matrix of test set is too large to upload.

Image：This folder contains figures and tables generated during analysis procedure.

Slides：This folder contains slides for presentations on week7 and week8 

Summary.ipynb: Jupyter notebook, an executive summary.
